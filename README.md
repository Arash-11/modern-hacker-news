This project is a clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) but with a minimalistic, modern UI, hence the name: Modern Hacker News.

# About the project

I created this website to read Hacker News in a more aesthetically pleasing format. And in the process, I removed parts of the original site that I do not use, which are the 'Comments' tab that displays comments from all posts on a single page (I can still read individual posts' comments), the ability to upvote a post, and the ability to login.

This project was also a good chance to practice my frontend ReactJS skills, and to learn how to use tools such as Webpack and Babel (I did not use create-react-app).
